<h1>Personal Statement </h1>

<h3>Valter Schmaltz</h3>
<h3>IT Support Technician</h3>
<h3>Manchester</h3>

<p>I am a technology passionate and self-motivated IT professional with a growth mindset and strong customer service experience in the IT sector. I aspire to take the next step in my career , and I believe this job is an excellent opportunity to further improve my Cloud skills - like AWS and Linux.</p>

<p>I first started in IT while in college, where I concluded an IT Support Technician Level 3 course. On this course, I had the chance to participate in a Regional Skills Competition and achieve the first place in Computer Networks area. I then got my first IT job, working as an IT Technician in a small local company, supporting hospitals and GPs in Brazil. I also deployed a ticketing system to the company and trained all staff members on how to use it. I then moved to the UK, where I spent three years working as a self-employed, and also supporting my local community with technical issues. Then, I started working for Amazon as a warehouse associate, where I could improve my social and communication skills. While in Amazon, I successfully got a job as an IT Support Technician. I have been assisting customers, performing audits, running projects, monitoring the infrastructure and much more among the help of an incredible team. It has been a fantastic experience.</p>

<p>In Amazon, I have had the valuable opportunity to join the Generation AWS re:Start program, a unique chance to step up in my IT career and advance my career path goals. With Generation, I was able to learn from experienced instructors and solidify all my existing IT knowledge with hands-on practice in Networking, Security, Linux, Bash Scripting, Python, Databases and all core AWS services. I have had many challenges; one of them was coding a complete Python program from scratch, you can check it on my Github page. I have also applied my AWS expertise to create my private DNS server with EC2, my web site with Route53, Apache and Docker. I have also configured a VPN server, which I use to connect to my home network from anywhere. If you found this interesting, please do not hesitate on asking for more details.</p>

<p>My career goal is to be a Cloud Specialist within three to five years time. I am confident that I am a perfect fit for a Cloud Engineer role as I will be applying all my problem solving and analytical skills to lead solutions. With my excellent learning and timekeeping skills, I am confident that I will get up to speed real fast. I am assured I will be a great asset to the company and to the Cloud Support team. I cannot wait to work with cloud technology and develop to a specialist level.</p>
