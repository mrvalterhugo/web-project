<h1>Personal Statement </h1>

<h3>Valter Schmaltz</h3>
<h3>IT Support Technician</h3>
<h3>Manchester</h3>

<p>I am a technology passionate and self-motivated IT professional with a growth mindset and strong 
customer service experience in the IT sector. I aspire to take the next step in my career as a Cloud Engineer. 
My career goal is to be a Cloud Specialist within three to five years.</p>

<p>I first started in IT while in college, where I concluded an IT Support Technician Level 3 course. On this course, 
I had the chance to participate in a Regional Skills Competition and achieve the first place in Computer Networks area. 
I then got my first IT job, working as an IT Technician in a small local company, supporting hospitals and GPs in Brazil. 
I also deployed a ticketing system to the company and trained all staff members on how to use it. I then moved to the UK, where I 
spent three years working as a self-employed, and also supporting my local community with technical issues. 
Then, I started working for Amazon as a warehouse associate, where I could improve my social and communication skills. 
While in Amazon, I successfully got a job as an IT Support Technician. I have been assisting customers, performing audits, 
running projects, monitoring the infrastructure and much more among the help of an incredible team. 
It has been a fantastic experience.</p>

<p>In Amazon, I have had the valuable opportunity to join the Generation AWS re:Start program, a unique chance to step up in my IT 
career and advance my career path goals. With Generation, I was able to learn from experienced instructors and solidify 
all my existing IT knowledge with hands-on practice in Networking, Security, Linux, Bash Scripting, Python, Databases and 
all core AWS services. I have had many challenges; one of them was coding a complete Python program from scratch, which you 
can check it on my Github page. I have also applied my AWS expertise to create my web site with AWS Amplify, 
Route53 and CodeCommit. I have also configured a Docker server in AWS EC2, running a VPN server which I use to 
connect to my home network from anywhere and even an Ad-blocking DNS Server. If you found this interesting, 
please do not hesitate on asking for more details.</p>

<p>I am confident that I am a perfect fit for a Cloud Engineer role as I will be applying all my problem solving and 
analytical skills to lead solutions. With my excellent learning and timekeeping skills, I am confident that I will get 
up to speed real fast. I am assured I will be a great asset to the company and to the Cloud team. I cannot wait to work 
with cloud technology and develop to a specialist level within a good company.</p>
